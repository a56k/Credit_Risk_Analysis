# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Using our knowledge of the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to evaluate three machine learning models by using resampling to determine which is better at predicting credit risks.


### Overview of the Analysis

The main objective of this analysis consist of analyzing how different machine learning models can assist in predicting credit card risk. Few steps are required within these models to gauge whether someone is classified "high or "low" risk. For instance, before capturing any of the results, it was important to seperate the data in two categories; training & testing Data. Once accomplished, we could then proceed with the different techniques such as RandomOversampler, SMOTE, ClusteerCentroid, SMOTEENN, and others to capture the neccessary results. 

### Results
--------------------------------------------------------
The first Test we ran was the Naive Random Oversampling, and it provided the following results
